Description:
Give an array arr that contains some integers, one of the integers appears times is more than the half of the total numbers of element(arr always has such a integer). Your task is to find it. For example:

arr = [0,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,0], should return 3
Of course, these integers are not always continuous ;-)

arr = [1,2,1,3,1,4,1,5,1], should return 1
Other numbers can be repeated too:

arr = [1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,5,5,5,1,1], should return 1
